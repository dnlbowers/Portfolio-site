                My name is David and I am now and always will be a developing developer. Even when I have mastered 100
                languages
                I still hope to be able to refer to myself as developing as in my opinion if the knowledge required for
                development
                doesn't increase as my experience expands, then my peers and I are not doing a good enough job at innovating
                in the field.
